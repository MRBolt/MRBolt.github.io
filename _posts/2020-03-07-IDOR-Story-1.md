**DIGEST**

We always have some curiosity to get private programs on Bug bounty platforms. This IDOR Story-1 going to have a small brief about the bug which helped me to enumerate the list of private programs on one of the private bug bounty platform.

**IDOR**

IDOR is a kind of Access control vulnerability. It's also more vulnerable as like other high severe issues. Its severity will get change based on the scenario and attack place.

**CVSS Vector String:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**Root Cause:**

An unprotected API endpoint without any access control validation.

**POC:**

A platform had many different programs. When I click on any program that takes me to a different page using the below-mentioned endpoint.

> https://sub.retacted.com/api/xxx/yyy/programs/9999

Whenever I changed that program number from "9999" to any other number, the application always took me to the custom error page.

After enumeration, I found different API end Points which is used to retrive the data of every programs,

> https://sub.retacted.com/api/xxx/yyy/organizations/9999/logo

Luckily this API endpoint is unprotected and allowed me to enumerate the logo of all the private and public programs and other details too ;)

**Solution:**

<p style="text-align:left;">1. The authentication and authorization policies are role based, to minimize the effort required to maintain these policies.
<p style="text-align:left;">2. The enforcement mechanism(s) should deny all access by default, requiring explicit grants to specific users and roles for access to every page.
<p style="text-align:left;">3. If the page is involved in a workflow, check to make sure the conditions are in the proper state to allow access.
<p style="text-align:left;">4. Default should be access denial - if user has access -> then allow.
<p style="text-align:left;">5. Avoid exposing your private object references to users whenever possible, such as primary keys or filenames.
<p style="text-align:left;">6. Instead of sending primary keys (like code in the above scenario) in URL, better to use session to send such a kind of information.
<p style="text-align:left;">7. This should be implemented for all the parameters used across all the pages in the application.
<p style="text-align:left;">8. Validate any private object references extensively with an "accept known good" approach.
<p style="text-align:left;">9. Verify authorization to all referenced objects.</p>
